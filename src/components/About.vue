            I've met some really great people through Destiny and I hope some of them enjoy the site.<br/><br/> 
            Dethony provides informal leaderboards for some game statistics in the spirit of fun 
            and maybe some healthy competition.<br/><br/>
            Due to the volume of data collected the stats will always be based on historical data 
            with the goal being an update at least once per day.  The collection process retrieves millions
            of data points so it's quite a task to update.
